Railway signalling in Luxembourg
================================

Introduction
------------

In Luxembourg, trains run on the right-hand side, so the signals are placed on this side of the tracks. An exception is line 5, where the trains run on the left side. When the signals are placed on the left, a plate with an arrow points to the track affected by the signal. There are two signal screens: a so-called "classic" signal screen with a black area surrounded by a white border, and a compact screen without this border. The compact screen is used in more recent installations, and its appearance is more reminiscent of the German signals. In accordance with convention, the tables in this document show the compact format on the left and the standard format on the right.

The signalling works in conjunction with the European Train Control System Level 1 (ETCS L1), which has replaced the speed control system Memor II+ derived from the Belgian Memor, which was discontinued at the end of 2019.

The Luxembourg signalling system is based on the German approach signal/main signal principle, and assigns a code to each signal and signal aspect. On the other hand, it incorporates various elements of the French signal system: Two yellow lights to signal the crossing of a switch at reduced speed (instead of the German combination of green and yellow light), the use of the Crocodile together with Memor II+, and the use of boards indicating electric traction.

There are four types of light signals:
- the _main signal (Signal fixe principal / SFP)_, which regulates the traffic flow,
- the _distant signal (Signal fixe avancé / SFAv)_, which announces the aspect of the next main signal,
- the _repeated distant signal (Signal fixe avancé répétiteur / SFAv))_, which repeats the last distant signal and is only placed if the main signal isn't visible from a certain distance, and
- the _barred track signal (Signal fixe de voie barrée / SFVb)_, which is a signal used to control shunting movements.

The SFP and SFVb signals can be combined, in this case the main signal is referred to as main signal with barred track signal (SFPVb) . Similarly, the main and distant signals can be fixed on the same mast.

If a signal or sign must not be taken into account, even when lit, it is covered by a Saint Andrew's cross (RM14: Cancellation marker for fixed signals out of order) which also cancels the complementary signals; if several signals are placed on a mast, only the one or those covered by a cross are cancelled.

Light signals
-------------

The light signals are designed and arranged to be visible from a distance. For this purpose, they are equipped with lenses to focus the light rays emitted by the light bulb, which can be selected at a reasonable power. For this reason, the lights do not appear to be very bright when viewed from the side when they illuminate violently in the normal axis of vision, i.e., in the direction of train arrival.

### Marking boards

Each light signal has a marker plate, which makes it possible to identify, even when switched off, which signal it is. This section also presents other very important tracking signals.
