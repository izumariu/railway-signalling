Railway signalling in Luxembourg
================================

Introduction
------------

In Luxembourg, trains run on the right-hand side, so the signals are placed on this side of the tracks. An exception is line 5, where the trains run on the left side. When the signals are placed on the left, a plate with an arrow points to the track affected by the signal. There are two signal screens: a so-called "classic" signal screen with a black area surrounded by a white border, and a compact screen without this border. The compact screen is used in more recent installations, and its appearance is more reminiscent of the German signals. In accordance with convention, the tables in this document show the compact format on the left and the standard format on the right.

The signalling works in conjunction with the European Train Control System Level 1 (ETCS L1), which has replaced the speed control system Memor II+ derived from the Belgian Memor, which was discontinued at the end of 2019.

The Luxembourg signalling system is based on the German approach signal/main signal principle, and assigns a code to each signal and signal aspect. On the other hand, it incorporates various elements of the French signal system: Two yellow lights to signal the crossing of a switch at reduced speed (instead of the German combination of green and yellow light), the use of the Crocodile together with Memor II+, and the use of boards indicating electric traction.
